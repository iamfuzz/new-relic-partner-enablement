# Welcome, Partner Relic!

The purpose of these labs is to help you get the most out of your partnership with New Relic. The activities cover typical activities encountered by New Relic users.

The labs are written for use with AWS. You will be able to follow along with the labs even if you are without a strong Linux, AWS, or New Relic background; but our advice is that you take some time along the way to understand what is happening and the context involved.

It is recommended you keep a document with screenshots with your progress in a diary format to help your learning.

# FAQ

### Is this the correct place to come to register as a partner?
No it is not. Head on over to the [New Relic Partner Program](https://newrelic.com/solutions/partners) for that.

### How long does it take to complete the labs?
Current testing shows this takes around 6 hours and 30 minutes. It is probably best to allow an entire day for this.

### What size instances do I need in EC2?
In CloudFormation you are asked to select an instance size. t2.micro instances work perfectly well.

### Are there any pre-requisites to the course?
It is expected you have completed [New Relic Fundamentals](https://learn.newrelic.com/fundamentals-course) before participating in the Enablement Labs.
A basic knowledge of AWS, command line (and SSH), and Linux is assumed.

### Will you be providing AWS access?
Unfortunately, no, and while we try to keep resource requirements to a minimum, please note that some of these labs may exceed AWS free tier usage.

### How do I get a New Relic account?
[Signing up for a free New Relic account](https://newrelic.com/signup) unlocks all entitlements. There is no credit card required. A free account is limited to 100GB ingest per month (more than enough for this lab series), it also provides unlimited basic users and limits to 1 full stack user.

### Can I give feedback?
Absolutely! Partner feedback drives the roadmap of the labs. Please leave a [request in GitHub](https://github.com/iamfuzz/new-relic-partner-enablement/issues/new).

### Taking pull requests?
Always! [Please feel free to do so](https://github.com/iamfuzz/new-relic-partner-enablement/pulls).
